I’m a dedicated Full Stack Software Developer and the CEO & President of CodeFlakes ICT. I’m currently working as a Software Developer on AFMIS – an enterprise-level financial management system at the Ministry of Finance, Department of the Treasury.

With a strong technical background, I specialize in:

C# (.NET) for building reliable and scalable backend systems

JavaScript for creating dynamic and responsive frontends

Flutter for cross-platform mobile applications

PHP (Laravel) for developing modern, maintainable web apps

I’ve successfully led and contributed to projects for both public sector institutions and private enterprises. My focus is on delivering clean, maintainable code and building systems that drive real impact.

I'm passionate about technology, leadership, and building solutions that help organizations thrive.
